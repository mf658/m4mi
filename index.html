<p>I based my piece of music in the sixth poem from “The Blue Beyond” by Jonathan Noel Lloyd.</p><p>The poem is about how ephemeral every being(the albatross) is and about how joyful and melancholic is is to be alive and to be mortal as well as how life carries on after death(the oceans).</p><p>Taking this into account, I wanted to create a musical narrative that states the life and death of a living thing such as “the albatross”. It starts by living in peace in the world to the sound of happy melodies and then death approaches slowly and then the music gets faster and darker which means the life of the albatross’ life is being taken away and then a moment of silence comes up which means its death. Right after that, different instruments come up which means that life carries on in other forms and in a melancholic way due to the ones who past away but still, looking ahead and having a bright look on future- this, to the sound of a bittersweet melody.</p>
<p>The methodology I used was quite simple: I used arpeggiated chords throughout the song and its positive or negative vibe and also its rhythm were the main elements of the musical narrative that really helped my to express my artistic vision.</p>

<p>When it comes to my goal for this assignment, I wanted to create a visual narrative and for that, I observed all the movements and the colours interweaving in the video so I could really express my vision through dynamics, rhythm and subtle appearance of sounds to give emphasis to what happens in the video. Another goal of mine was to really create the effect of synaesthesia in which images and sounds mix and I believe I achieved it by associating the right sounds to the different movements of the colourful lights.</p>

<p>For this assignment, I decided to take risks and create several layers of music that work as parallel elements to the several colours, movements and different sensations we experience while watching the video. By adding the right sounds, that takes the visual experience further by creating a mix of sensations. I mostly used the sound of synthesizers to go along with the different parts of the video that worked during the different parts and also as transitions inbetween colours and even inbetween transition of colours, of movements, of shapes, etc. Taking this into account, I made use of the Mickey Mousing Technique which was one of the main goals for this project.</p>

<p>With this assignment, I wanted to create satisfaction for the player by associating each specific move to a specific sound. With this system, the player tends to feel joy and gratification by feeling the victory through an additional sense: the audition and not only though the vision. Evidently, one of my other goals for this assignment was to make the sound design simple but effective and on time for every move.</p>
